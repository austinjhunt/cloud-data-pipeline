  # Additional Notes:
  # for the curl command, add --yes to gpg so that when rerun it will 
  # auto input yes 
  # for the echo command, from the turotial, there are some additional \ and \
  # these additional \ are causing it not set up properly. Remove these and put it in a single line 
  # to avoid unwanted issues
  # for the apt-get commnad from the tutorial, I tried to use the ansible apt, but got some errors. 
  # switch to shell for simplicity
  # when running install command, I got the following error
  # E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend. It is held by process 41411 (apt-get)
  # found a solution at https://itsfoss.com/could-not-get-lock-error/
