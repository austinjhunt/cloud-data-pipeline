# Automation Archive

This master.yml playbook and the roles in this folder were used for assignment 2 in which we were installing packages and services directly on the VMs since we were not using containers. For assignment 3, we don't need to do this, we only need to install container and orchestration packages (k8s, docker). All of the direct installations will be replaced with steps built into the Docker images using Dockerfiles.
