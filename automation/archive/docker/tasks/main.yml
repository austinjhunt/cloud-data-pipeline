# for the echo command, from the tutorial, there are some additional \ and \
# these additional \ are causing it not set up properly. Remove these and put it in a single line
# to avoid unwanted issues
# for the apt-get commnad from the tutorial, I tried to use the ansible apt, but got some errors.
